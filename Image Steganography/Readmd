This project is related to Image Steganography.

Stegnography is used to hide secret data into a cover object. This cover object can be image, video, audio, text.

1. Image Steganography:
Concealing information within digital images. It involves modifying pixel values or adding extra data in the image to hide the secret message.
2. Audio Steganography:
Hiding data within audio files. Similar to image steganography, audio steganography involves modifying the audio data to embed the secret message.
3. Video Steganography:
Concealing information within video files. This technique alters frames or adds data to video frames without causing noticeable changes to the video quality.
4. Text Steganography:
Embedding hidden messages within the text of a document. This can involve various techniques, such as modifying letter spacing, word choice, or formatting.
5. File Steganography:
Hiding data within various file formats, such as documents, spreadsheets, or presentations. The hidden information can be embedded in specific areas of the file.
6. Protocol Steganography:
Concealing information within the protocol headers of network communication. This technique involves modifying packet headers to hide data.
